<br>I want to discuss the importance of mastery in video games, featuring the revived arcade classic, Clockwork Aquario.</br>

<br>Due to this game originating as an arcade title, it has to focus on the depth of content rather than the quantity. This often goes towards the difficulty of the game, being more demanding on the player to ensure they put more money into the arcade machine. 
Clockwork Aquario falls into the depth of difficulty, as it gives the player limited lives, limited health, and a precise attack window.
This makes it more challenging for players, forcing them to master the way the game is played in order to progress in the game. Players will have to replay stages, finding strategies that will ensure a smooth play through.</br>
<br>This sort of philosophy relates to the game (game) in the story, which mainly focused on repetition, improving after each throw. Players will find themselves right back to level one, noticing that they are getting better and faster at traversing stages. There will be less mistakes and the game will be beaten in no time. Players get so skilled at these arcade games that they start making challenges for themselves, one popular challenge being the ‘1CC run’ (1 credit clear). These kinds of runs require flawless gameplay from players, making the stakes higher as you only get one try at beating the game. Those that attempt these kinds of challenges are pushed to learn the game inside and out to insure the perfect run.</br>
